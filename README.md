### 🌻 About Me

I’m currently pursuing my **M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence**, trying to make sense of everything from LLMs to Docker errors to my 4th cup of coffee.

Not your “born coder” story — I just really love learning, fixing stuff, and making cool ideas come to life.  
Whether it’s a secure image encryption system or an AI that gives financial advice (without ghosting you), I’m all in.

### 💻 Projects That Kept Me Up at Night

#### 🧠 From Voice to Value: A Multi-Modal AI Assistant for Personalized Financial Advice  
- Built an AI assistant that listens to your financial worries and responds like it cares.  
- Used **TF-IDF + ANN** for 97% accurate intent classification.  
- Pulled real-time data from **stock, crypto, macroeconomic**, and **news APIs**.  
- LLM-powered responses via **Gemini** — because why not throw a large language model at your money problems?

#### 🔐 CipherLens: Intelligent Image Encryption & Decryption System  
- Developed a tool to encrypt images so well, even I needed a cheat sheet to decrypt them.  
- Combined **AES, Blowfish, and Triple DES** with randomized logic and seed persistence.  
- Easy-to-use GUI with live visual feedback, because command-line-only life is sad.

#### ✋ Sign Language Recognition Using ML  
- Made a webcam-based system that recognizes 15+ static signs with **93% accuracy**.  
- Built with **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and custom ML models (SVM, Random Forest).  
- Added a friendly GUI so people could actually use it — not just stare at logs.
